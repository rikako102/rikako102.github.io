			<br>I worked in the Interiors division, which dealt with everything on the interior of the car: dashboard, seats, sun visor, cup holders, etc.
			<br><br>My main role was putting out fires; I found recurring problems on the assembly line and did a root cause analysis to solve them.

			<h3>One major problem I solved was air vents that rattled and jammed during inspection. </h3>
			To find the root cause, I began by observing installation on the manufacturing line. On 30 random Model X's, I compiled data on gap tolerances, force efforts, and a percentage of defective parts.
			<br><br>
			From this, I found two problems:
			<ul>
				<li> A panel in the air vent was not aligning properly, which created the clicking noise </li>
				<li> Incorrect installation techniques were used on the assembly line, which probably made the manufacturer defects worse.</li>
			</ul>
			<br><br>
			<img class="assemline" src="images/assemblyline.png">
			<br><br><h3>This created two opportunities for improvement. </h3>
			<p class="yes">
				<br><i>On the supplier side</i>, I set up a meeting to talk about my findings and discuss quality of parts and manufacturing. However, because supplier improvements can take weeks to take effect, I created a temporary countermeasure in the meantime that was implemented on the production floor.
				<br><br>
				<i>On the assembly side</i>, I rewrote the work instructions in greater detail to decrease chance of error in installation. I reviewed them with the line managers, who were responsible for passing along the instructions to the night shift. 
				<br><br>
				<h3>The rate of error decreased by 50% within 3 days of implementing changes. When reworked parts were introduced, the error frequency was 0-1%, which is within the acceptable range. </h3>

		<h2><i> Is that all you did at Tesla? </i></h2>
		<p> Not at all! My other tasks included reviewing CATIA files for the Model 3, which was not in production yet at the time, fixing tolerances in door-to-body connections, and performing a similar process with the air vents on misaligning instrument panels.
