			<br><br><br>I worked with the Color team, who develops all of Glossier's makeup products, like <u>Generation G</u>, <u>Perfecting Skin Tint</u>, or <u>Lash Slick</u>. 
			<br> <br>
			During my time there, I assisted with ongoing and future projects, including: 
			<ul class="glosslist"> 
				<li> conducting user testing at all stages of development for multiple products </li>
				<li> keeping tabs on trends, launches, and current competitive products </li>
				<li> establishing shade and formula benchmarks </li>
				<li> using color theory for shade matching </li>
				<li> creating slide decks to be presented to executive members </li>
			</ul>

			The project I dedicated the most time to this summer was for a future launch. At the time I joined, the next steps of development were testing our confirmed formula with users and using their feedback to inform our next product iterations. This data would be the evidence for why we moved forward with these shades. <br><br><br>
			I coordinated testing with over 45 panel subjects, including Glossier employees, models, and makeup artists. I tested all our subjects three times each with product adjustments in between for a combined total of over 15 hours of testing. Through the painstaking feat of scheduling around new product submissions, busy schedules, and time constraints, I discovered the perfect length of each testing session was 20 minutes. (the little victories!)

			I also implemented a new cataloguing system to better represent the data we collected from testing. This came from the frustration of having well-documented photos on a camera, but no way to see trends and quickly make new categories as needed. 
			<br>So, we came up with a two step system that brought polaroid pictures into the mix. That way, we immediately had a physical token of the testing session that we could lay out and organize in front of usâ€” see proof on the left. We still had our high-quality picture to reference for shades and to catalog our data digitally, but being able to lay out information physically brought some interesting and useful trends to the surface.
			<br> <br>
			At my internship's end, I participated in presenting this information to the Senior Vice President of Marketing. The meeting summarized the conclusions we reached through extensive testing and product iterations, including some unexpected trends and takeaways.

	<p class="glossproblem"> 
		<b> <i>How might we keep tabs on the product closet's inventory in a no-fuss, streamlined way? </i></b> 
		<br> <br>
		Glossier keeps all current products at the office for testing, referencing, and gifting. Throughout the summer, this was a constant pain point for employees because they could never know 

		However, there was no good way of keeping track of when stock would run low so there were often times when we were without a product. How might we keep tabs on the inventory in a no-fuss, streamlined way? I created a shareable spreadsheet that documents the quantity of each product. It also lists the date last checked, by whom, and when the last re-ordering occurred. When a quantity dips below 5, the spreadsheet cell turns red. The solution was simple, effective, and adaptable. 
	</p>
	<p> In a small, fast-working company like Glossier, frequent communication between Product Development and cross-functional teams (R&D, Packaging, Creative, Copywriting, Supply Chain, Project Management, Marketing) was vital for a smooth project timeline. </p> <br>-->
