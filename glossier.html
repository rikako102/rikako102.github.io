		I was a Product Development Intern for <u><a href="glossier.com/about">Glossier</a></u>, a cosmetic and skincare company. My team was Color, which deals with all makeup products (e.g. Generation G, Perfecting Skin Tint, Lash Slick). 
		<br> <br> 
		The purpose of this internship was to assist my team with tasks regarding ongoing and future projects, including: 
		<ul> 
			<li> conducting user testing at all stages of development for multiple products </li>
			<li> keeping tabs on trends, launches, and current competitive products </li>
			<li> creating slide decks to be presented to executive members </li>
			<li> establishing shade and formula benchmarks </li> 
			<li> using color theory for shade matching </li>
		</ul>
	 Here's an example. <br> </p>

	<p class="glossprojects"> 
		The main project I worked on was an upcoming color launch (not yet released). The stage of development it was in when I entered this project was confirming shades with vendors and confirming the final number of products to launch. 
		<br>
		To confirm these shades, I coordinated testing with over 45 panel subjects, including employees, models, and makeup artists, who were split into separate categories determined separately. We tested this entire set of people three times with product adjustments in between for a combined total of over 15 hours of testing at 20 minutes averaged per person — which ended up being the temporal sweet spot.
		<br>
		Additionally, I implemented a new cataloguing system to better visually represent the data we collected from testing. This involved a one-two punch system of a polaroid photo and an iPhone 10 photo of the shade testing. The polaroids allowed us to physically lay out our data quickly which greatly helped in reaching conclusions based on trends, and the iPhone photo was a detailed, accurate shot of the tested product to organize digitally.
		<br>
		At my internship's end, I had the opportunity to participate in presenting this information to the Senior Vice President of Marketing. The meeting summarized the conclusions we reached through extensive testing and product iterations, including some unexpected trends and takeaways.

	<p class="glossproblem"> 
		<b> Problem Solving </b> 
		<br> 
		Oh, the inventory closet. Glossier keeps all current products at the office in case of testing, referencing, and gifting. However, there was no good way of keeping track of when stock would run low so there were often times when we were without a product. How might we keep tabs on the inventory in a no-fuss, streamlined way? I created a shareable spreadsheet that documents the quantity of each product. It also lists the date last checked, by whom, and when the last re-ordering occurred. When a quantity dips below 5, the spreadsheet cell turns red. 
		<br>
		Simple, effective, and adaptable. 
	</p>
	<p> In a small, fast-working company like Glossier, frequent communication between Product Development and cross-functional teams (R&D, Packaging, Creative, Copywriting, Supply Chain, Project Management, Marketing) was vital for a smooth project timeline. </p> <br>
