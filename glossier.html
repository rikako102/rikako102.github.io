	<h2>I was a Product Development intern at <i><a href="https://www.glossier.com/about" target="_blank">Glossier,</a></i> a cosmetic and skincare company. </h2>

			<br>I worked with the Color team, who develops all of Glossier's makeup products (e.g. <a href="https://www.glossier.com/products/generation-g" target="blank"><u>Generation G</u></a>, <a href="https://www.glossier.com/products/boy-brow" target="blank"><u>Boy Brow</u></a>, & <a href="https://www.glossier.com/products/lash-slick" target="blank"><u>Lash Slick</u></a>). 
			<br> <br>
			During my time there, I worked on ongoing and future projects, including: 
			<ul> 
				<li> conducting user testing at all stages of development for multiple products </li>
				<li> keeping tabs on trends, launches, and current competitive products </li>
				<li> establishing shade and formula benchmarks </li>
				<li> using color theory for shade matching </li>
				<li> creating slide decks to be presented to executive members </li>
			</ul>

			<h3>I worked most on testing a future product's formula with users and using their feedback to inform our next product iterations. </h3>
			I coordinated testing with over 45 panel subjects, including Glossier employees, models, and makeup artists. Scheduling around new product submissions, busy schedules, and time constraints, I tested all our subjects three times each with product adjustments in between for a combined total of over 15 hours of testing. 
			<br><br>
			Each testing period was punctuated with comments to the formula vendor, and began again with new samples. Through all this testing, we iterated through multiple shade families and landed on a definitive final number.

			<h3>I also implemented a new cataloguing system to better represent the data we collected from testing. </h3>
			We had a lot of great documentation from a phone camera, but we were frustrated at not being able to see trends and regroup people by shades. So, we came up with a new two step system.
			<ul>
				<li> Polaroids: with these, we immediately had a physical token of the testing session that we could lay out and organize in front of us. There's mine on the left!</li>
				<li> High-quality photo: this came after the Polaroid for digital cataloguing and future shade referencing </li>
				being able to lay out information physically brought some interesting and useful trends to the surface.

			<h3>At my internship's end, I helped present this information to the Senior Vice President of Marketing. </h3> The meeting summarized the conclusions we reached through extensive testing and product iterations, including some unexpected trends and takeaways.

		<h2> <i>Is that all you did at Glossier?</i> </h2>
		<p> 
			Not at all! My tasks were those of a Product Development Coordinator: conducting shade matching for current products, researching competitive landscapes and benchmark products, maintaining the constant flow of the product closet, creating pitches for upcoming projects, participating in internal cross-functional meetings, and developing new and innovative products, of course.

	<p class="glossproblem"> 
		<b> <i>How might we keep tabs on the product closet's inventory in a no-fuss, streamlined way? </i></b> 
		<br> <br>
		Glossier keeps all current products at the office for testing, referencing, and gifting. Throughout the summer, this was a constant pain point for employees because they could never know 

		However, there was no good way of keeping track of when stock would run low so there were often times when we were without a product. How might we keep tabs on the inventory in a no-fuss, streamlined way? I created a shareable spreadsheet that documents the quantity of each product. It also lists the date last checked, by whom, and when the last re-ordering occurred. When a quantity dips below 5, the spreadsheet cell turns red. The solution was simple, effective, and adaptable. 
	</p>
	<p> In a small, fast-working company like Glossier, frequent communication between Product Development and cross-functional teams (R&D, Packaging, Creative, Copywriting, Supply Chain, Project Management, Marketing) was vital for a smooth project timeline. </p> <br>-->
