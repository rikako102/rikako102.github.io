			<br><br>I worked with the Cleaning and Organization team, who deals with products like household cleaning supplies, bathroom storage, and kitchen organization.
			<br><br>
			My summer was mostly dedicated to beginning the development process for a new cleaning product from scratch. The process was:
			<ul class="oxolist"> 
				<li>User and competitive market research </li>
				<li>Competitive product testing </li>
				<li>User testing — employees </li>
				<li>User testing — in-home visits  </li>
				<li>Brainstorming potential mechanisms</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

			<br>
			User and market research started with diving deep into the top competitive products, identifying opportunity spaces in the market, and finding out what consumers really thought about existing products, good and bad. I sent surveys out to real-life users to better understand habits.
			<br><br>
			Then began the several rounds of testing. 
			<br> <p class="o1"> First, I tested out how the competitive cleaning products held up. I created a gross, sticky concoction in the OXO kitchen that mimicked something awful to clean and recorded my findings. You could even see my handiwork from the outside of the building, seen right. </p>
			<p class="o2"> Next, I had employees around the office try it out, both frequent and infrequent users of this cleaning tool. The feedback from these sessions began to mold my focus for future criteria.</p>
			<p class="o3"> Finally, we found users willing to participate in our in-home testing. We went to houses all over New York to observe all the quirks and habits that were imbedded in this cleaning procedure. </p>
			<p class="o4"> By the end of my internship, first round testing had been completed and we were looking into vendors for potential mechanisms that seemed to work the best across all our testing. </p>

		<h2> Is that all you did at OXO? </h2>
		<p> Not at all! My tasks often overlapped with the engineering departments and I joined a few of their projects to diversify the skills gained during the summer. 
			<ul>
				<li>I performed Finite Element Analysis (FEA) via SolidWorks on an upcoming product that was undergoing final engineering checks. </li>
				<li>I created a testing rig for the Coffee and Tea team for underwater electrode testing. I frequented the HQ's small machine shop to create it to specifications. </li>
			</ul>
		On top of that and my main project, I assisted with multiple ongoing projects, all in various stages of development. Some include final testing for the <u><a href="https://www.oxo.com/coffee-grounds-cleaning-scoop.html" target="_blank">Coffee Grounds Cleaning Scoop</a></u>, updating the <u><a href="https://www.oxo.com/oxo-good-grips-aluminum-dish-rack.html" target="_blank">dish rack</a></u>, as well as conducting second stage testing and concepting for other yet-to-be-launched products.
