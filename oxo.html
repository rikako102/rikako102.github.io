		I was a Product Development Intern for <u><a href="https://www.oxo.com/our-philosophy">OXO</a></u>, an innovative consumer products company. I specifically worked with the Cleaning and Organization team, who dealt with products like household cleaning supplies, bathroom storage, and kitchen organization. 
		<br><br>
		OXO is a titan in the industry for their incredible products that are centered around, first and foremost, the user. A wall in their offices is covered floor to ceiling with lost gloves of all kinds - big or small, child or adult, fashion or utility - to remind the employees that we're working to create for <i> everyone, </i> regardless of age, gender, or ability. With this internship, I contributed to OXO's thoughtful process as a problem becomes an idea becomes a product. 
		<br> <br>
		My main task of the summer: begin the development process for a future cleaning product (not yet released). By the end of my ten weeks, I completed most of the user research and benchmark testing. 

		This started with diving deep into competitive products, identifying white spaces in the market that our product could fill, and figuring out what consumers really thought about existing products — good and bad. 

		<b> We test to inform our final product decisions with real user experiences. </b>
		<br>
		With these notes in mind, the next step was creating a more knowledgable base and seeing first-hand the major problems users run into with the best products on the market. 
		ran several rounds of testing. For all, I made a concoction designed to mimic something hard to clean. The first round was for myself and my manager. We applied the mixture to several surfaces and tested benchmark products and functional prototypes to immerse ourselves in the experience and become experts of this cleaning tool. 

		The final segment of testing was in-person tests. We identified several people outside of the office who often use the cleaning tool in question and visited them to see their process. We were able to see the quirks that arise in normal routines that words alone aren't enough to descibe usually thought of when asked to describe a process. We tested out our cleaning tool in actual homes, and

		My main goal for this internship was a better understanding of the product development process. However, I often interacted with the engineering departments and asked to join a few of their projects to diversify the skills gained during the summer. 
		I performed Finite Element Analysis (FEA) via SolidWorks on an upcoming product that was undergoing final engineering checks.
		I created a testing rig for the Coffee and Tea team for underwater electrode testing. I frequented the HQ's small machine shop to create it to specifications.
