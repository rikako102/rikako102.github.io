	Spring 2018, I took my first website development class, called Human-Computer Interaction. The skill of creating a better user experience is a common theme in many classes I've taken during my time at Northwestern and I was eager to learn the technical skills to expand my skillset.
	<br> <br>
	My entire website is a passion project, a visual representation of what I have learned. Although it is a relatively simple website, no templates are used. There are four main pages: home, about me, my work, and contact information. 
	<br> <br>
	This website is a constant work in progress and is no doubt going to change for the better in the future. As with any good product development, any user comments or feedback is extremely valuable to me. If you have a moment to spare, leave your suggestions or thoughts here-- xxxxx.
