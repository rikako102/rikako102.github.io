	The Lagkage rocking chair is a study of light in curves and white spaces. <br>
	<i> Materials: </i> Bamboo plywood, brass T-nuts. <br>
	<i> Instructor: </i> Erling Christoffersen
	
	<br><br>
	We had to follow a few guidelines: 
	<ul>
		<li> It must be made from bamboo plywood, a sustainable and low impact material </li>
		<li> It must disassemble into flat-pack pieces, like IKEA furniture </li>
		<li> The chair must not exceed 60 x 60 x 60 inches </li>
	</ul>

	To create a design, we studied iconic Scandinavian furniture and architecture designs. In particular, Wegner's <i>"The Round Chair"</i> and Alvar Aalto's Paimio Sanatorium were great inspirations. Through these inspirations, I brainstormed different forms and structures for my chair. Relatively early on, I knew I wanted to create a rocking chair for the uniqueness and the challenge. I loved Hans Wegner's iconic chairs that incorporated the backrest with the arms (e.g. <u><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=the+round+chair&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS730US730&oq=the+round+chair&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j69i60l4.2264j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">the Round Chair</a></u>, <u><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=the+wishbone+chair&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS730US730&oq=the+wishbone+chair&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0l5.2118j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8"> the Wishbone Chair</a></u>), in all their sweeping elegance. I did not want a design with harsh, intimidating angles. After brainstorming different forms and structures, I settled upon a final design. 
	<br><br>
	Then, we constructed full-scale mockups of these chairs out of cardboard to see the full effect. This was a model of my initial design. The horseshoe-shaped armrest would hit mid-back when sitting, and shorter slats that echoed the shape of the armrest would be suspended above and below, creating a longer backrest. The seat is full and supportive. The rockers are long, angling slightly towards each other as they go back.
	<br><br>
	Through this exercise, I entertained the thought of getting rid of the shorter top slats at the suggestion of my instructor. The continuous back/armrest becomes the focal point, and simplifies the look.
	<br><br>
	When it was time to work at the woodshop consistently, seen at right, construction began. Our first run was creating our chairs from particle board. This was to ensure no surprises when we create our final chair with the bamboo plywood, which we had limited stock of. 
	<br><br>

		The wooden slats that create the back of the chair are tapered; the shortest is nearest to the seat and gradually gets longer as you get closer to the top. The highest piece fully extends to the front of the chair, creating armrests. <br>

	<i>Lagkage</i>, in Danish, means layer cake. It is a traditional Danish cake commonly made for birthdays and celebrations. It consists of several layers of cake and cream, usually filled and topped with fruit. It became my chair's name because I wanted to reflect its personality and form, but also to symbolize the incredible cultural experience I was fortunate enough to experience in those four months.

<p> Fact: This Fall 2017 Furniture Design program almost didn't happen. Enrollment was incredibly low - just 2 people - and the program was about to cut it. I sent an empassioned email explaining why this cannot be the case, and I wore them down. It was a cozy semester with a lot of one-on-one instructor attention and bonding with my classmate, seen at right.
