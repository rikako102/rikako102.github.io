			<h3>The Lagkage rocking chair is a study of light in curves and white spaces.</h3>
			<i>Lagkage</i> is Danish for "layer cake". Traditionally, it's served for birthdays and special occasions, often with lots of Danish flags stuck in them. 
			<br><br>
			I chose this name for my chair because of the layered slats that make up the backrest, but also to remind me of the incredible cultural experiences I had living as a Dane with my host family.

		<h3> Guidelines for the build: </h3>
			<ul>
				<li> Made from bamboo plywood, a sustainable and low impact material </li>
				<li> Disassembles into flat-pack pieces with minimal hardware, like IKEA furniture </li>
				<li> Cannot exceed 60 x 60 x 60 inches </li>
			</ul>

		<p class="brainstorm">
			<h3> Obviously, Scandinavian design was a huge inspiration. </h3>
			In particular, Hans Wegner's <i>"The Round Chair"</i>, Alvar Aalto's Paimio Sanatorium, and Alejandro Castro's <i>R Sofa</i> played a huge role in my brainstorming. I also knew from early on that I wanted to design a rocking chair for the challenge and creative potential. 
			<br><br>
			Once I had a favorite design, I constructed a full-scale cardboard mockup.

			 <h3>Some key designs to note: </h3>
			 <ul>
			 	<li> A backrest of slats extending above and below the armrest... </li> 
			 	<li> ...which, fully inspired by Wegner, extends from a backrest
			 	<li> Rockers that angle inward for stability </li>
			 	<li> A broad seat, ~110 degrees off the back, for maximum comfort </li>
			 </ul>
			<br>

	<div class="block5">

		<p class="modification">
			At Erling's suggestion, I entertained the thought of getting rid of the top two slats. That way, the long armrest becomes the focal point, and simplifies the overall design.
			<br><br>
			<h3>One major issue I ran into was the curvature of the rockers.</h3>
			It depends on the weight and center of mass of the rest of the chair, so I built several full-size rocker feet out of particle chip board to test. To not feel like you were going to tip over backwards every time, a fairly flat curve was needed.

			<h3>After some design iterations, I began building.</h3>
			A design choice I made during the build was the lengths of the wooden slats. In its final form, <i>Lagkage</i> has four slats; the one closest to the seat is shorter than the one above it, and so on until the fully extended armrest at the top. 
			<br><br>
			There are only 10 separate parts in this chair. The only hardware needed in constructing <i>Lagkage</i> is brass t-screws; everything else is snugly fit together.

			This chair currently resides in California, waiting to be transported to a more permanent home.

			<h2> Fun fact: The furniture program almost didn't happen. </h2>
			<p> Enrollment for Fall 2017 was incredibly low - just 2 people - and the study abroad program was about to cut it. I sent an empassioned email explaining why this <i> couldn't </i> happen, and I convinced them. It was a cozy semester with a lot of one-on-one instructor attention and bonding with my only classmate.
