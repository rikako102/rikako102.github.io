	The Lagkage rocking chair is a study of light in curves and white spaces. <br>
	<i> Materials: </i> Bamboo plywood, brass T-nuts.
	
	<br><br>
	My core study abroad course, Furniture Design, was centered around designing and building a chair. There were a few guidelines: 
	<ul>
		<li> It must be made from bamboo plywood, a sustainable and low impact material </li>
		<li> It must disassemble into flat-pack pieces, like IKEA furniture </li>
		<li> The chair must not exceed 60 x 60 x 60 inches </li>
	</ul>

	To create a design, we studied iconic Scandinavian furniture and architecture designs. In particular, Wegner's <i>"The Round Chair"</i> and Alvar Aalto's Paimio Sanatorium were great inspirations. For a challenge, I decided to design a rocking chair. After brainstorming different forms and structures, I constructed full-scale mockups of these chairs out of cardboard to see the full effect.

	Many Danish designs combine the backrest with the arms (e.g. the Round Chair, the Wishbone Chair)

			I loved the Danish designs that incorporate the backrest with the arms (e.g. The Round Chair, The Wishbone Chair) because of the flow and elegance of the form. This was the starting point for my chair, creating the round form throughout.

		The wooden slats that create the back of the chair are tapered; the shortest is nearest to the seat and gradually gets longer as you get closer to the top. The highest piece fully extends to the front of the chair, creating armrests. <br>

	<i>Lagkage</i>, in Danish, means layer cake. It is a traditional Danish cake commonly made for birthdays and celebrations. It consists of several layers of cake and cream, usually filled and topped with fruit.

<p> Fact: This Fall 2017 Furniture Design program almost didn't happen. Enrollment was incredibly low - just 2 people - and the program was about to cut it. I sent an empassioned email explaining why this absolutely couldn't be the case, and I wore them down. It was a cozy semester with a lot of one-on-one instructor attention and bonding with my classmate, seen at right.
