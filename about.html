<p> <img class="picofme" src="images/mee.jpg"> Rika Ko is a designer and engineer who loves creative, hands-on projects. She is currently a senior at Northwestern University, studying a self-created major in the McCormick School of Engineering: Human-Centered Product Design and Development. This major is designed around the product cycle, specifically the portion from brainstorm and ideation to development and hand-off into manufacturing. 

<br> <br> Her three internships at <a href="glossier.html">Glossier</a>, <a href="oxo.html">OXO</a>, and <a href="tesla.html">Tesla</a> have created an extremely unique set of skills and experiences. In three vastly different industries, I've stayed true to working directly with products.

Some fun facts:<br>

<br> I studied abroad in Copenhagen, Denmark for 4 months, where I had begun to love running for fun. It turns out I just really liked running <i> specifically </i> in gorgeous Danish forests with my host family's dog, Fiffi. </p> 
<img class="fiffiimg" src="images/fiffi.JPG"> 
<p class="explanation"> <i> Said beautiful forest and dog. </i> </p>

<p class="descriptiontext"> My sister and I have our own Slack channel because we're both more likely to respond to each other quicker that way.</p>
<img class="slackname" src="images/sisterslack.png">
<p class="explanation"> <i> I can't include more than the name because the rest is quite embarrassing. </i> </p>

<p class="descriptiontext"> My favorite food is the kid's macaroni and cheese from Outback Steakhouse. I will absolutely still order it today. <br>
