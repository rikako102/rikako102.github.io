		<p> Hey, nice to meet you. I'm a recent alumnus of Northwestern University, McCormick School of Engineering. I love making things, which is reflected in my current job at Kendo Brands doing Product Development, and in my past projects building a chair in Copenhagen and doing Product Development for Glossier and OXO. Currently looking for new opportunities to design and develop the next best thing.
		<br>
		<br>Other than that, I'm a California native who loves podcasts and DIY projects. You can also find me planning my next hike or smiling at a dog that just walked our way.

Some fun facts:<br>

<br> I studied abroad in Copenhagen, Denmark for 4 months, where I had begun to love running for fun. It turns out I just really liked running <i> specifically </i> in gorgeous Danish forests with my host family's dog, Fiffi. </p>

<p class="explanation"> <i> Said beautiful forest and dog. </i> </p>

<p class="descriptiontext"> My sister and I have our own Slack channel because we're both more likely to respond to each other quicker that way.</p>

<p class="explanation"> <i> I can't include more than the name because the rest is quite embarrassing. </i> </p>

<p class="descriptiontext"> My favorite food is the kid's macaroni and cheese from Outback Steakhouse. I will absolutely still order it today. <br>
