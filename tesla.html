	<h2> I was a Product Excellence Intern at <i><a href="https://www.tesla.com/about">Tesla Motors,</a></i> an electric car manufacturer. </h2>

			In Product Excellence, my main role was to perform root cause analysis on the recurring problems on the assembly line. <br>
			
			Any issues found during assembly of the cars or in final inspections are logged into an internal system where my team views them, along with the frequency of the problem and any obvious trends (e.g. only in the night shift, only happening on the right side of the car).
			<br><br>
			I worked in the Interiors division, which dealt with everything on the interior of the car: dashboard, seats, sun visor, cup holders, etc.

			One major problem I solved during my internship involved the dashboard air vents of the Model X (see right). During final inspections, these vents were jamming and created a rattling noise in drive tests. 
			<br> <br>
			To find the root cause, I began by observing installation on the manufacturing line. On 30 random Model X's, I compiled data on gap tolerances, force efforts, and a percentage of defective parts. Through this, I found that a panel in most of the air vents was not aligning properly which created the clicking noise. Additionally, after observing the installation process in the assembly line, I also found that incorrect installation techniques were being used on the assembly line, which likely exacerbated the defects in the supplier components.
			<br><br>
			<h3>This created two opportunities for improvement. </h3>
			<i>On the supplier side</i>, I set up a meeting to present my findings and discuss quality of parts and manufacturing. However, because supplier improvements can take weeks to take effect, I created a temporary countermeasure in the meantime that was implemented on the production floor.
			<br>
			<i>On the assembly side</i>, I rewrote the work instructions in greater detail to decrease chance of error in installation. I reviewed them with the line managers, who were responsible for passing along the instructions to the night shift. 
			<br><br>
			Within 3 days of instating countermeasures and retraining assembly workers, the rate of error decreased by 50%. When reworked parts were introduced, the rate fell to 0-1%, which is within the acceptable range.

		<h2> Is that all you did at Tesla? </h2>
		<p> Not at all! My other tasks included reviewing CATIA files for the Model 3, which was not in production yet at the time, fixing tolerances in door connections, and finding the root cause issue of misaligning instrument panels. Cool, right? If you want to know more, <u><a href="contact.html">talk to me about it.</a></u></p>

<!-- Other duties included communicating with all facets of the supply chain (manufacturers and suppliers, designers, assembly line workers, managers, and engineers of various departments) and presenting data of major issues to upper management and a board of engineers. -->
